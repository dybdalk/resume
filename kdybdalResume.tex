	\begin{itemize}
	\item Demonstrates the capabilities of functional programming by generating the most secure "rotors" their characters for a word-based combination lock when given a number of rotors, number of characters per rotor, and the number of characters that should be considered for each rotor
	\end{itemize}
	\item {Personal:} Python Platform Game - https://github.com/dybdalk/to-the-heights
	\begin{itemize}
	\item A simple platform jumping game written in python. it's in pre-alpha right now, so it's playable, but a lot of the artwork and rules tweaks have yet to be implemented
